Sorry for not posting in a while... There are a couple reasons why that I will touch in this post.


# Life

There have been a lot of things happening IRL. Me, my brother, and my parents have had to leave the house we lived in for a long time because our landlord had turned on us, including friends on his side.
It's been very tiring working outside to prepare for the new home to be put down.


# School

School has been very hard, and its been made harder by many of my friends leaving school, or just not being in the friend group anymore.


# Online

My friends have also been very inactive online, making me very bored. Also, someone had attempted to groom me, so theres that.


# Burn Out

I've been burnt out for a long while, since I have ran out of ideas for projects. Constantly trying to make new projects has added more weight to that burn out. My burn out is gone, but with it gone it also has left me without any ideas.


# Current Plans

There aren't many projects I've been working on. But, _there is one that will have a demo soon..._

I hope that clears everything up. Thank you for sticking with me.

**QUICK NOTE:** This is the first post made using NeOrg.
