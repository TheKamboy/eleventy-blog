The Simple Console Menu documentation was fine where it was, at Notion, but I wanted to experiment with making Documentation with **11ty**, so they are now here.

This *might* be the last update done for Simple Console Menu, as things like [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh) are very popular. In fact, I use it for quite a bit of my projects! 

You will find out eventually, if the project still doesn't get updates, even after this post.

<!-- [^1]: In fact, I've started using huh with quite a couple of my projects. -->
