# SCM: Installation
<div class="message-box">
	<p><em>You need to have a Go project already set up to use these instructions.</em></p>
</div>

Once your terminal is in the project, you can run this command:
``` shell
go get github.com/TheKamboy/Simple-Console-Menu
```

Now, open up your `main.go` file, and add this:
``` go
import (
	cmenu "github.com/TheKamboy/Simple-Console-Menu"
)
```
